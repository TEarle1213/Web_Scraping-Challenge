# Web_Scraping-Challenge

Scraped data from the Mars News site. Used Python and Beautiful Soup to convert site html into usable data and then Pandas to assemble scraped data into a DataFrame. All functions were done with the use of jupyter notebook. Closed out the assignment by saving dataframe into a CSV file for later reference and use.
